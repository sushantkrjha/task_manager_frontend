# Task Management App

A task management application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. It features user authentication with JWT token-based security and provides a dashboard view for users to manage their tasks efficiently. The project uses React for the frontend and integrates with a Django backend API for managing tasks and user authentication.



## Description

This is a full-stack task management application that allows authenticated users to:

- Create new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- View all tasks.
- Edit and delete tasks.
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
- View a responsive dashboard with tasks listed for the logged-in user.

This app can be used to manage personal tasks, track progress, and collaborate with team members (if extended in the future). It integrates with a Django backend for handling API requests, including user authentication and task management.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React (for building UI components)
  - React Router (for routing)
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - React Context API (for managing authentication state)
  - CSS (for custom styling or Tailwind CSS for styling)

- **Backend**: 
  - Django (for the backend API)
  - Django REST Framework (for creating RESTful API endpoints)
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens for authentication)

- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL or MySQL (assumed backend database)

- **Development Tools**:
  - Node.js
  - npm or yarn (for package management)
  - Docker (for running both backend and frontend in containers)

## Installation
npm install
npm start


### Prerequisites
